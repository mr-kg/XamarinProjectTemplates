# Xamarin Project Templates
A repo containing project templates that streamline Xamarin development

Used in this repo:
- MvvmCross for its excellent cross-platform application
- Serilog for its versatility
- Xam.Plugin.Settings for its versatility when persisting settings data
- Newtonsoft.Json because ... It's Json.Net!
- .NET Standard

All templates are in a workable state and can be found in the /Exports folder.
To install these, simple copy the .zip file into your ProjectTemaplates folder and it will appear in VisualStudio when creating a new Project/Solution
